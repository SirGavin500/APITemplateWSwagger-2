 // I had to use endpoints in swagger to use my C# code to do my restaurant picker, magic 8 ball and guess it

 // You can add multiple dates with description.

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Nicolas Gonzaba- Restaurant picker doesn't tell you what categories are avaliable unless you look at the code itself. Magic 8 ball has no place to input your question and thusly has no data validation. Otherwise code looks fine.
